        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          While I'm comfortable with many frontend concepts, there are areas

          <p>
            "Remember why you started this journey - to create technology that
            makes people's lives better. Don't get caught up in the latest
            frameworks; focus on solid fundamentals and user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep learning, stay curious, and always prioritize accessibility.
            The web should be for everyone, and you have the power to make that
            happen."
